              youâ€™re a beginner or an expert, your questions and answers help

          <p className="text-lg text-gray-500 mb-6">
            Move is a relatively new smart contract language, and as such, it
            lacks the large, established community and resources that other
            ecosystems enjoy. This can make it challenging for new developers to
            find help, share knowledge, and grow their skills. DeAudit AI was
            created to fill this gapâ€”our mission is to foster a vibrant,
            supportive community for Move developers, where everyone can learn,
            collaborate, and build securely. With the added power of AI, we make
            it even easier to get expert insights, audit your code, and accelerate
            your journey in the Move ecosystem.
